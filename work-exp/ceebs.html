        While I was working with the disutils team, we also accepted commisions
        for custom bots. One of them was the
        <a href="https://www.ceebs.site">Ceebs Project</a>. Ceebs is a platform
        made for the Monash University which allows students to make or accepts
        deliveries from other students. This allows them to make a few quick
        bucks in their free time. I was the lead developer for a while, handling
        in making all the features for a few months, until I started to get
        burnt out while handling the commision work and disutils. That was when
        I had found an amazing developer from the Monash University who was
        interested in the project. From then on I mentored him and with his help
        made the development much easier. <br /><br />
        After my team member had enough experience in working with the code
        base, I trusted him to take care of the project and left Ceebs. After
        working for about 5 months on the project, I felt my growth stagnating
        and couldn't give time to my personal projects, regardless, the Ceebs
        project was a very interesting project to work on and I'm thankful to
        Lachlan Nguyen who gave me opportunity. It made me learn a lot about
        integrating various API's and systems like Stripe, verification system
        and even had to make a custom API interacting with Airtable API
        asynchronously.
